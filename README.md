# PositionalAudio

Is a powerful component in three-dimensional environments that enables spatialized audio playback. This GitHub repository provides a concise implementation example of how to integrate and utilize PositionalAudio within a Three.js scene.

# Key Features

Spatialized Audio: PositionalAudio enables the creation of immersive audio experiences by associating sounds with specific 3D positions within a scene. As users move around, the audio adjusts dynamically based on their proximity to the sound source.

Interactive Triggering: Through user interaction, exemplified in this code snippet by a click event, PositionalAudio can be activated or deactivated. This interactivity enhances user engagement and allows for dynamic audio control within the scene.

Integration with OrbitControls: The integration with OrbitControls provides users with the ability to navigate the 3D environment while experiencing the spatialized audio effects generated by PositionalAudio. This combination enriches the overall immersive experience of the scene.

# Usage Example

In this example, PositionalAudio is instantiated with a specified audio file (sound.mp3). 

Upon activation (triggered by a click event on a mesh), the audio starts playing in a loop and adjusts dynamically based on the user's position within the scene, with a maximum audible distance set to 4 units away from the sound source.

# Code Structure

The useState hook manages the state of the audio playback, toggling between play and pause states.

The clickHandler function toggles the play state of the audio upon a click event on the mesh.

The OrbitControls component enables user interaction, allowing for navigation within the 3D scene.

# Conclusion

PositionalAudio is a valuable addition to Three.js applications, offering a seamless way to integrate spatialized audio within interactive 3D environments. This repository serves as a practical reference for developers looking to incorporate PositionalAudio into their projects, enhancing the immersive qualities of their virtual experiences.
